// 1.Step 94
// Your pyramid generator is still working. However, it could be possible to end up with an infinite loop again.

// Because you are only checking if done is not equal to count, if done were to be larger than count your loop would go on forever.

// Update your loop's condition to check if done is less than or equal to count.

// The solution:
let done = 0;

while (done <= count) {
  done++;
  rows.push(padRow(done, count));
}
// running tests
// tests completed

// 80% complete
