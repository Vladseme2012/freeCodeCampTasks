// 1.Step 24
// In the last few steps, you learned all about working with arrays. Take a moment to review what you have learned.

// Start by declaring a cities variable and initializing it as an array of the strings "London", "New York", and "Mumbai". Then log that variable to the console.

// After logging, change the last element of cities to the string "Mexico City", then log the cities variable again.

// When done correctly, you should see this output in the console.

// Example Code
// [ "London", "New York", "Mumbai" ]
// [ "London", "New York", "Mexico City" ]

// The solution:
let cities = ['London', 'New York', 'Mumbai'];
console.log(cities);
cities[cities.length - 1] = 'Mexico City';
console.log(cities);
// running tests
// tests completed
// console output
['London', 'New York', 'Mumbai'][('London', 'New York', 'Mexico City')][
    ('Naomi', 'Quincy', 'CamperChan')
];
