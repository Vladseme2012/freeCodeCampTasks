// 1.Step 28
// You should have seen "freeCodeCamp" printed to the console. This is because .pop() returns the value that was removed from the array - and you pushed "freeCodeCamp" to the end of the array earlier.

// But what does .push() return? Assign your existing rows.push() to a new pushed variable, and log it.

// The solution:
rows.push('freeCodeCamp');
let pushed = rows.push();
console.log(pushed);
// running tests
// tests completed
// console output
4;
freeCodeCamp[('Naomi', 'Quincy', 'CamperChan')];
// 24% complete
