// 1.Step 47
// The logic for formatting this pyramid is likely going to get complicated, which means it's a great time to extract that code into a function.

// A function is a block of code that can be reused throughout your application. Functions are declared with the following syntax:

// Example Code
// function name(parameter) {

// }
// The function keyword tells JavaScript that the name variable is going to be a function. parameter is a variable that represents a value that is passed into the function when it is used. A function may have as many, or as few, parameters as you'd like. Like a for loop, the space between the curly braces is the function body.

// Declare a padRow function. Do not create any parameter variables yet. The function body should be empty. Remember that you need to use camel case for your naming convention.

// The solution:
function padRow() {}
// running tests
// tests completed
// console output
// 40% complete
