// 1.Step 99
// What if you made your pyramid upside-down, or inverted? Time to try it out!

// Start by creating a new for loop. Declare your iterator i and assign it the value of count, then use the boolean false for your condition and iteration statements.

// The solution:

/*while (rows.length < count) {
  rows.push(padRow(rows.length + 1, count));
}*/

// running tests
// tests completed
// console output

// 83% complete
