// 1.Step 60
// Below the return statement, log the string "This works!" to the console.

// After doing that, you will see that the string "This works!" does not display in the console, and the console.log("This works!") line is greyed out.

// Copy the console log and paste it above the return statement. Now, the string "This works!" should appear in the console.

// An important thing to know about the return keyword is that it does not just define a value to be returned from your function, it also stops the execution of your code inside a function or a block statement. This means any code after a return statement will not run.

// The solution:
function padRow(name) {
    const test = 'Testing';
    console.log('This works!');
    return test;
    console.log('This works!');
}

console.log(test);
// running tests
// tests completed
// console output
// This works!
// This works!
// Testing
// 51% complete
