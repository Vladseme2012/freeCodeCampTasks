// 1.Step 101
// Your iteration statement is also going to be different. Instead of adding 1 to i with each loop, you need to subtract 1.

// Like you did earlier with i = i + 1, update your iteration statement to give i the value of subtracting 1 from itself.

// The solution:

for (let i = count; i > 0; i = i - 1) {}

// running tests
// tests completed

// 86% complete
