// 1.Step 77
// JavaScript also has support for multi-line comments. A multi-line comment starts with /* and ends with */.

// Unlike a single-line comment, a multi-line comment will encapsulate multiple lines.

// Use /* and */ to turn your current for loop, including the body, into a multi-line comment.

// The solution:
/*for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}*/
// running tests
// tests completed
// console output
// 65% complete
