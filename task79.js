// 1.Step 84
// Now that you have practiced working with if...else if...else statements, you can remove them from your code.

// Once you complete that, use let to declare a continueLoop variable and assign it the boolean false. Then use let to declare a done variable and assign it the value 0.

// The solution:
let continueLoop = false;
let done = 0;
// running tests
// tests completed
// console output

// 71% complete
