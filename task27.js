// 1.Step 31
// Declaring a variable with the let keyword allows it to be reassigned. This means you could change character later to be a completely different value.

// For this project, you will not want to change these variable values. So instead, you should use const to declare them. const variables are special.

// First, a const variable cannot be reassigned like a let variable. This code would throw an error:

// Example Code
// const firstName = "Naomi";
// firstName = "Jessica";
// A const variable also cannot be uninitialized. This code would throw an error:

// Example Code
// const firstName;
// Replace your let keywords with const.

// The solution:
const character = "Hello";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
// running tests
// tests completed
// 26% complete
