// Your pyramid has disappeared again. That's okay - that is to be expected.

// Before you create your new loop, you need to learn about if statements. An if statement allows you to run a block of code only when a condition is met. They use the following syntax:

// Example Code
// if (condition) {
//   logic
// }

// The solution:
if (true) {
    console.log('Condition is true');
}
// running tests
// tests completed
// console output
('Condition is true');
// 64% complete
