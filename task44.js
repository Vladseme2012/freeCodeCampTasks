// 1.Step 49
// You are calling your padRow function, but not doing anything with that function call. All functions in JavaScript return a value, meaning they provide the defined result of calling them for you to use elsewhere.

// To see the result of calling your padRow function, declare a call variable and assign your existing padRow call to that variable.

// The solution:
const call = padRow();
call;
// running tests
// tests completed
// console output
// 42% complete
