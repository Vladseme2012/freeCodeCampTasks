// The text has appeared again! This is because "false" is a string, which when evaluated to a boolean becomes true. This means "false" is a truthy value.

// A truthy value is a value that is considered true when evaluated as a boolean. Most of the values you encounter in JavaScript will be truthy.

// A falsy value is the opposite - a value considered false when evaluated as a boolean. JavaScript has a defined list of falsy values. Some of them include false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN.

// Try changing your if condition to an empty string "", which is a falsy value.

// The solution:
if ("") {
  console.log("Condition is true");
}
// running tests
// tests completed
